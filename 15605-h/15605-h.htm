    <h2>IMPRESSIONS OF "IL TROVATORE."</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By a Matter-of-Fact Philistine at Covent
    Garden.</i>)</h4>

    <p>ACT I. SCENE 2.&mdash;<i>Leonora's</i> confidant evidently
    alive to the responsibilities of her position. Watch her, for
    example, when her Mistress is about to confide to her ear the
    dawn of her passion for <i>Manrico</i>. She walks
    <i>Leonora</i> gently down to the footlights, launches her into
    her solo, like a boat, and stands aside on the left, a little
    behind, with an air of apprehension, lest she should come to
    grief over the next high note, and a hand in readiness to
    support her elbow in case she should suddenly collapse. Then,
    feeling partially reassured, she goes round to inspect her from
    the right, where she remains until her superior has completed
    her confidences, and it is time to lead her away. Operatic
    confidant sympathetic&mdash;but a more modern heroine might
    find one "get on her nerves," perhaps. <i>Manrico</i> a very
    robust type of Troubadour&mdash;but oughtn't a Troubadour to
    carry about a guitar, or a lute, or something? If
    <i>Manrico</i> has one, he invariably leaves it outside.
    Probably doesn't see why, with so many competent musicians in
    the orchestra, he should take the trouble of playing his own
    accompaniments. And why does the Curtain invariably come down
    as soon as swords are drawn? Tantalising to have all the duels
    and fighting done during the <i>entr'actes.</i></p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/193-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/193-1.png"
             alt="Manrico, a rather full-blown 'Ghost in Hamlet.'" />
             </a>Manrico, a rather full-blown "Ghost in Hamlet."
    </div>

    <p>ACT II. SCENE 1.&mdash;<i>Azucena</i> insists on telling
    <i>Manrico</i> a long and rather improbable story of how, in a
    fit of absorption, she once burnt her own son in mistake for
    the <i>Conte di Luna's, Manrico</i> listens, as a matter of
    filial duty&mdash;because, after all, she is his
    mother&mdash;but he is clearly of opinion that these painful
    family reminiscences are far better forgotten. Perhaps he
    suspects that her anguish may be due to a severe fit of
    indigestion&mdash;the symptoms of which are almost
    indistinguishable from those of operatic remorse. At all
    events, he does not find his parent a cheerful companion, and,
    as soon as he finds a decent excuse for escape, takes it.</p>

    <p>SCENE 2.&mdash;The Cloisters of a Convent. <i>Enter</i> the
    <i>Conte di Luna</i>, with followers, to abduct <i>Leonora</i>.
    The followers range themselves against a wall in the
    background, until the Count has finished "<i>Il Balen</i>." If
    their opinion was asked, they would probably be in favour of
    his making rather less noise about it, if he really means
    business&mdash;but of course it is not <i>their</i> place to
    interfere. <i>Leonora</i> enters to take the veil, with
    procession of nuns, preceded by four female acolytes&mdash;or
    are they pages?&mdash;in white tights, carrying tapers. The
    Count and his followers are evidently a little taken
    aback&mdash;an abduction not quite so simple an affair as they
    expected. While they are working themselves up to it,
    <i>Manrico</i> appears, as the stage-direction says, "like a
    phantom." In a helmet, with a horsehair tail, and a large white
    cloak, he does look extremely like the <i>Ghost</i> in
    <i>Hamlet</i>, and which is, perhaps, why the Count, under the
    impression that he is an apparition from some other Opera,
    allows him to Walk off with <i>Leonora</i> under his very nose.
    Swords are drawn&mdash;with the usual result of bringing down
    the Curtain.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/193-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/193-2.png"
             alt="'Azucena,' or, 'My pretty Chain!'" />
             </a>"Azucena," or, "My pretty Chain!"
    </div>

    <p>ACT III. SCENE 1.&mdash;Soldiers discovered carousing, as
    wildly as is possible on four gilded cruets, and a dozen
    goblets. <i>Azucena</i> is brought before the Count, and
    manacled. Operatic handcuffs&mdash;a most humane
    contrivance&mdash;with long links, to permit of the freest
    facilities for entreaty and imprecation. Soldiers, who have
    been called to arms, but stayed, from a natural curiosity to
    hear what the <i>Conte di Luna</i> had to say to the Gipsy, go
    off, as she is led away to prison, with a sense that they have
    seen all there <i>is</i> to be seen, and a vague recollection
    that there is some fighting to be done somewhere.</p>

    <p>SCENE 2.&mdash;<i>Leonora</i>, and <i>Manrico</i> are about
    to be married; everything prepared&mdash;four apathetic
    bridesmaids, and the four acolytes in tights&mdash;who have
    possibly been kindly lent by the Convent for the
    occasion&mdash;in a vacuous row at the back of the scene. Fancy
    <i>Manrico</i> has forgotten to give them the usual initial
    brooches, and they feel the wedding is a poky affair, and take
    no interest in it. <i>Leonora</i> herself is in low
    spirits&mdash;seems to miss the confidant, and to be oppressed
    with a misgiving that the wedding is not destined to come off.
    Misgivings on the stage are never thrown away&mdash;the wedding
    <i>is</i> interrupted immediately by a crowd of men, in small
    sugar-loaf caps, who carry the bridegroom off to
    fight&mdash;whereupon, of course, the Curtain falls.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/193-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/193-3.png"
             alt="Luna and the Star of the Evening." /></a>Luna and
             the Star of the Evening.
    </div>

    <p>ACT IV. SCENE 1.&mdash;<i>Leonora</i> listening outside the
    tower in which <i>Manrico</i> is being tortured, after having
    been taken prisoner in a combat during the <i>entr'acte</i>.
    Here a confidant might have comforted her considerably by
    representing that they couldn't be torturing the poor
    Troubadour so <i>very</i> seriously so long as he is able to
    take part in a duet&mdash;but unfortunately <i>Leonora</i>
    seems to have discharged the confidant after the Second
    Act&mdash;an error of judgment on her part, for she is
    certainly incapable of taking care of herself. A cool-headed,
    sensible confidant, for instance, would have taken care that
    the bargain with the <i>Conte di Luna</i> was conceived and
    carried out in a more business-like spirit.</p>

    <p>"Now <i>do</i> be careful," she would have said. "Make sure
    that the Count keeps <i>his</i> word before you break
    <i>yours</i>. Don't go and see <i>Manrico</i> yourself&mdash;it
    <i>can</i> do no good, and will only harrow you! If you really
    <i>must</i> go, don't take a quick poison first&mdash;or you'll
    die in his dungeon, and spoil the whole thing!" Which is just
    what <i>Leonora</i>&mdash;like the impulsive operatic heroine
    she is&mdash;proceeds to do, and is cruelly misunderstood by
    <i>Manrico</i>, in consequence, besides hastening his doom by
    disappointing the Count, whose irritation was only natural, and
    pardonable, under the circumstances.</p>

    <p>Don't quite see myself why the Count should be so horrified
    on learning that the person he has just had executed was his
    long-lost brother. It is not as if they had ever been friendly,
    or were at all likely to become so, considering their previous
    relations. Depend upon it, when he has time to think the matter
    over calmly, he will recognise that things are better as they
    are, and that Fate has solved his domestic difficulties in the
    only possible manner. A Troubadour Brother, with a revengeful
    and quite unpresentable gipsy foster-mother, would have proved
    very trying persons to live with.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"A CHIEL'S AMANG YE MAKING NOTES."&mdash;Sir ARTHUR SULLIVAN
    sat next to Sir HENRY HAWKINS during part of the recent
    sensational trial at the Ancient Bailey, making, of course not
    taking, notes. Sir HENRY occasionally conversed with the Knight
    of Music. Did the latter hum, <i>sotto voce</i>, "<i>And a good
    Judge too!</i>" with other selections from <i>Trial by
    Jury</i>? Everyone glad Sir ARTHUR is so well. Perhaps after
    this he will return to Real Eccentric Gilbertian Opera, and go
    away for "change of air." The "Carte" is at the door, ready to
    take him, but his original "Gee Gee" has gone to America.</p>

    <h2>THE COUNTY-COUNCILLOR'S DIARY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A few Years hence.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;To-day's meeting of the Council rather
    stormy. The Council's Clerk of the Works, who superintends the
    fifty thousand builders, bricklayers, &amp;c., who are now
    employed directly by us, reports that, unless the concessions
    demanded by the men are granted, they will all go out on strike
    to-morrow. The concessions are&mdash;Free beer three times
    a-day; half-holiday every other day at full day's wages; and a
    month's trip to the Riviera in winter, paid for out of the
    rates. Clerk of the Works (appointed, on elective principle, by
    the men themselves) describes these demands as "highly moderate
    and reasonable." Council unable to agree with him. After
    sitting for six hours, amid frightful uproar, Council breaks
    up, without coming to any decision.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Workmen <i>have</i> struck! Awkward,
    as they have just pulled down north side of Strand, to make
    room for double lines of electric tramways in centre of
    roadway, and whole street in an awful litter. Begin to wish we
    had not "Abolished the Contractor" quite so hastily.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Another meeting of Council. Quite
    unanimous to go on resisting men's demands. Clerk of Works
    reports that the Council's scavengers, plumbers, carters,
    lamp-lighters, and turncocks, are all threatening to strike, in
    sympathy with bricklayers. In consequence of evident enjoyment
    with which Clerk makes this announcement, proposal to decrease
    his salary from that of a Lord Chancellor to that of a Puisne
    Judge, carried <i>nem. con</i>. In spite of attacks on Council
    in the Press, satisfactory that it knows how to keep up its
    dignity at this crisis.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Matters getting serious. A deep fall
    of snow has occurred, and Council's men refuse to clear it
    away, or let others do the work! In addition, Strand tradesmen
    come in body to Spring Gardens to say that "nobody can get near
    their shops, and they are being rapidly ruined."
    Hastily-convened meeting of the Council. Proposal to ask our
    old Contractor to rebuild Strand and clear snow away. Our old
    Contractor declines to tender for the job! He says, "Council
    has abolished the Middleman, and had better get on without him,
    if it can!" Rude, but forcible.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Council heroically decides to do the
    work itself. Am told off by Chairman to help remove old bricks
    on the Strand site. Have first to dig snow away to get at
    bricks. Intense amusement of hostile crowd, from whom we are
    protected by a cordon of police. Bark my shins badly against
    wheel of cart. Chairman&mdash;who has been extremely energetic
    in running up and down a ladder with a hod of mortar over his
    shoulder, which he thinks is bricklaying&mdash;falls from
    ladder and is taken off to Charing Cross Hospital; amid shower
    of brickbats. Crowd wants to know "which is McDOUGALL." When
    they find out, pelt him with snowballs. BURNS&mdash;who has
    stuck loyally to Council&mdash;fiercely denounced as a
    "blackleg" by crowd. Amusing at any other time. Home in evening
    dead tired, under police escort. Find all my front windows
    smashed! After all&mdash;<i>was</i> it wise to abolish the
    Contractor?</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Whole County Council, protected by
    several regiments from Aldershot, a park of Artillery, and all
    the City Police (Council's own Police being out on strike, in
    sympathy with bricklayers), manage with great difficulty to
    fill ten carts with rubbish, and then adjourn to Spring
    Gardens. Refreshments and free sticking-plaster handed round
    before Meeting takes place. Meeting unanimously decides to
    re-establish old Middleman system! Sir JOHN LUBBOCK humorously
    suggests that it is, at any rate, better than the "muddle-man"
    system which we have tried and found wanting. Bonus of £5,000
    out of rates, enthusiastically voted to any Contractor who will
    tender for job of clearing snow and widening Strand.</p>

    <p><i>Later</i>.&mdash;High Court disallows our "precept" for
    the £5,000 bonus&mdash;says we must pay it out of our own
    pockets!</p>

    <p>Wish I had never stood for London County Council!</p>

    <h2>ROBERT'S COMPANIONS. No. 2.</h2>

    <p>Another of our speshal lot is good old SAM, with his
    wunderfool memmery. He won't tell not nobody his age. But he
    acshally swears as he remembers the time when there wasn't not
    no Cabs, nor no Homnybusses nor no Hallways, nor no Steam
    Botes, nor no Perlice, in all Lundon! And when there was grate
    droves of Cattel and Sheep druv thro' the streets, and people
    used to have to put up bars at their doors to keep 'em out. And
    menny and menny a time has he seen a reel live Bullock march
    into his Master's Counting 'Ouse, with his two wild horns a
    sticking out, and as it was to narrer for him to turn hisself
    round, he used to have to be backed out tale foremost, with a
    fierce dog a barking at his nose.</p>

    <p>Ah, them must have been rayther rum times, them must! How
    the peepel got about he don't seem quite to remember; but he
    says, as how as amost all on 'em lived at their warious shops
    and warehouses, and so mostly walked. There was, it seems, a
    few ramshackel old coaches, called Ackney Coaches&mdash;coz,
    they was all maid at Ackney, I suppose&mdash;all drorn by two
    ramshackel old Osses, and with werry shabby old drivers with
    wisps of stror round their shabby old hats. Then some brite
    Genus went and inwented Cabs, and they soon cut out the Ackney
    Coaches, which all went back to Ackney, and was never seen no
    more. And then, sum ewen briter Genus went and inwented
    Homnybusses, and they rayther estonished the Cabs, and what the
    next brite Genus will inwent in that line, I don't know, and
    SAM don't know, and I don't suppose as nobody else don't. But
    the most wunderfullest thing of all must have bin the having of
    no Perlice! For SAM, acshally declares, that before Perlice was
    inwented by Sir ROBERT PEEL&mdash;therefore wulgarly called
    Bobbys and Peelers&mdash;the only pertecters as London had at
    night was a lot of werry old men, all crissened CHARLEY, who
    used to sit in little boxes, such as the Solgers has at the
    QUEEN's Pallaces, with a little lantern hanging up in front,
    and when the Church Clocks all struck the hour, they all used
    to git out of their boxes and wark up and down the streets a
    calling out, "Parst Three o'Clock!" or "Parst Five o'Clock!" as
    it mite happen to be, and then go back to their little boxes,
    and hang up their lanterns, and quietly go to sleep! Ah, them
    must have been werry nice times for Messrs. DICK TUPPIN, JACK
    SHEPHARD, BILL SIKES, and Cumpny, unlimited. But, SAM says, as
    they made up for it by hanging ewery body as stole amost
    anythink, such as a sheep, or a fi-pound note, or a gold watch,
    and that on Mondays, which was Hanging Days, he has offen and
    offen stood at the hend of the Hold Baley and seen sum five or
    six pore retches, with white nite caps on, all a hanging
    together! and he says it all so serously that we are forced to
    bleeve him.</p>

    <p>Then there's old slowcoach Jo, the tea-totaller. We all
    likes to work with him, and for a werry good reeson. But he's
    rayther a comical feller is Jo. He says, when peeple cums to
    know all the true fax of the case, they'll willingly pay dubble
    price for tea-total Waiters. And he reelly is such a poor
    simple fellow that I werrily bleeves as he bleeves hisself when
    he says it. I carn't think what he means by it; but BROWN says
    as it's a perfeckly shameful attack on the charackter of all us
    Waiters as ain't such fools as to be Tea-totallers, and that we
    really ort all of us to cut him. But no&mdash;I'm in favour of
    Free Trade in Waiters as in Wine, and I shoud think that, in
    this pertickler case, his hobstinacy brings its own punishment.
    For what can be a creweller life for a poor Waiter to lead,
    than to be constantly surrounded by harf emty bottels of most
    bewtifool Wines, of all kinds, so as to suit the most
    fastidgeous Waiter's taste, and not ellowd to taste ewen one
    glass of 'em! I thinks as I've heard of sum unfortnit
    hindiwidial, in holden times, as used to be seated down hevrey
    day to a werry scrumpshus dinner, but, whatever he fixt his
    mind upon, the Doctor woudn't allow him to taste it, not by no
    means. His name, I think, was SANKY PANSER, some relashun of
    MOODY and SANKY, I sposes. His master's name was DAN QUICKSHOT,
    ony another name, I bleeves, for BUFFALO BILL. But that was
    nothink of a case to wun as my son WILLIAM told us of the other
    day. It seems as there was, wunce upon a time, a Greshian Gent,
    by the name of TANTLUS, who, becoz he was found out in helping
    hisself to sum werry speshal brand of Neckter, was condemned to
    stand up to his neck in water for ewer so many years; and altho
    he was so dredfool thusty that he would have drunk a lot of
    ewen that cold, thin stuff, he wasn't allowed not to taste a
    drop; and, not only that, but there was a lot of most bewtifool
    frute a hanging jest above his pore hed, and whenever he tried
    jest to pluck a bit of it, the crewel wind blowed it away out
    of his reach. Hence the prowerb, "You be blowed!"</p>

    <p>In course I don't pertend to know how these things was
    manidged in former times, but I werry much douts whether ewen a
    Greshian Gent's constitushun coud posserbly have stood it for
    ewer so menny years!</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;Most delightful weather favoured us
    last week at Gatwick and Sandown, and most of the horses I
    mentioned as worth following either finished nowhere or were
    not there at all, which I think is a fair average record for a
    Turf prophet! I heard at Sandown that sweeping reforms are to
    be expected in Turf matters next Season, but I will not harp
    too much on this string, as more able pens than mine have
    undertaken it&mdash;though how a "pen" can harp on a string I
    don't quite see&mdash;or <i>hear</i>, it should be.</p>

    <p>I certainly think <i>Brandy</i> would have won the Gatwick
    Handicap, but I suppose the bottle is getting low, and is being
    reserved in case the Cambridgeshire is run on a cold day! And
    that brings me to the consideration of this great race. I do
    not propose to analyse the form of all the horses, but will
    devote my attention to a few of the likely ones&mdash;who
    should feel complimented thereat (I suppose a horse; can feel a
    compliment just as well as it can a whip)&mdash;from which
    might spring the winner. First and foremost, then, <i>La
    Flèche</i> has, in my opinion, enough weight to carry, even if
    the jockey is included, as I believe is the case&mdash;and I
    was told by Sir CHARLEY WHITELEY, that to win the Newmarket
    Oaks she had to be "bustled up"&mdash;a fashion which I thought
    had quite gone out!&mdash;anyhow, many people think she is "not
    the same mare she was"&mdash;though how they can have changed
    her I don't quite understand, but it would not surprise me to
    find <i>Windgall</i> the best of the Baron's on the day.</p>

    <p>There are several horses spoken of as "rods in pickle," but
    as a rule, these animals stop at "rods" and never get to
    "poles" much less "perches!" Should Sir JAS. MILLER win the
    race, the town may resound with many a merry <i>Jödel</i>, but
    this is trying weather for voices, though I believe he is
    running untried, but certainly trying! There was some doubt as
    to the starting of a great favourite, owing to a report that
    the owner had been "forestalled"&mdash;an excuse which always
    sounds very weak to me, as surely if outsiders can back a horse
    at a long price, the owner should also be able to do so, and
    thus put backers "in the cart"&mdash;where <i>some</i> of them
    would present a picture which might lead people to think the
    "cart" was on its way to Tyburn! There appears to be
    considerable doubt as to whether <i>Buccaneer</i> has eaten
    anything lately or not, so I must discard him; but I think if
    he were given a sherry and bitters at once he might recover his
    appetite and win, as he is known to be a "glutton" for work!
    JEWITT's best will take some beating, when we know which it is,
    which we shall do shortly, as no stable is more ready than this
    to let everyone into the secret of their "good things;", so if
    some <i>Whisperer</i>, should tell you that his
    <i>Suspender</i> is broken, it is on the cards that the
    <i>Pensioner</i> may still be able to walk home in safety! But
    enough of this (as your readers will doubtless say!)&mdash;and
    let us come to the point as the knife said to the
    pencil&mdash;so I will conclude by recommending a "maximum" on
    my choice, and as it is a foreign one, I must necessarily break
    out into foreign poetry&mdash;(just as easy to&mdash;),</p>

    <h2>WAS, IS, AND WILL BE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Three Periods of Biography.</i>)</h4>

    <p>PAST (<i>Historical</i>).&mdash;General SIMEON SNOOKES was
    one of the greatest Commanders that ever figured in an European
    war. His defence of Herren-Bayoz, in 1796, will be long
    remembered by those of his grateful countrymen who feared that
    the Corsican upstart would get the upper hand in the
    semi-fraternal struggle in the Portugo-Hispanian Peninsula. A
    service nearly as important was performed when SNOOKES (then a
    Colonel), led the forlorn hope that gave PEGGE WELL BEY (the
    Turkish conqueror) into the grasping hands of the British
    Government. Yet still another victory was scored when Captain
    SNOOKES forced the gates of Ram and Mar, and brought the proud
    Earls of the Five Free Ports to their knees and their senses.
    That he should have received the freedom of the City of London
    was as it should have been, and it must have been gratifying to
    his sorrowing friends and relatives that Royalty itself should
    have been represented at his obsequies. His fame as a
    victorious General will never fade, and although his private
    life may have been uninteresting, his connection with the noble
    family of DE SCROGGYNS will for ever gain for him the respect
    of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

    <p>PRESENT (<i>Anecdotal</i>).&mdash;General
    SNOOKES&mdash;better known in the last century as "SIMPLE
    SIMON"&mdash;was a most interesting personage. Of his military
    career it is unnecessary to speak, as it was extremely
    commonplace, and void of incident. He was a <i>petit
    maître</i>&mdash;and numerous tales are told of his gallantry.
    On one occasion, meeting Lady BESSIE FRIZZYHEAD; on the Green
    at Turnham, he called attention to the fairness of the sunset.
    "Quite like cream, Lady BESSIE," said the old <i>beau</i>,
    taking a pinch of snuff. "Whipped, you mean," replied the
    malicious maiden, with a smile. "SIMPLE SIMON" simpered, but
    never forgave the liberty. At another time the General was
    speaking to the late Duke of York, when that illustrious
    personage commanded the British Army. "I say, SIMMY," exclaimed
    H.R.H., "if the French invade us, you must look after Number
    One." "You mean, Sir," was the prompt answer, "Number One
    Hundred and One!" The King, hearing this anecdote a little
    later, made "SIMPLE SIMON" his extra Equerry. But perhaps the
    best story of all was that told of his interview with Dean
    SWIFT. "I propose listening to your Reverence on Sunday," said
    the simple one. "Oh, indeed!" replied the sarcastic
    ecclesiastic. "Then we shall have a case of a <i>Gulliver</i>
    come to judgment!" Many other good stories are told of this
    General, whose career was rather in the drawing-room than in
    the field of glory. He died in 1825, and was buried in
    Westminster Abbey. At his funeral there was a large assemblage
    of the best-known people of the day, and amongst them the
    Editor of the <i>National Defender. "Sic transit gloria</i>,"
    said some-one. "<i>Mundi</i>!" added the journalist.</p>

    <p>FUTURE (<i>Conjectural</i>).&mdash;SNOOKES, SIMEON. No one
    knows who this person was, but it is shrewdly conjectured that
    he may have had some official connection (possibly as a
    Government contractor) with one of the ancient wars. As his
    monument is defaced, and there are no records of his family, it
    is useless to attempt to make his biography any fuller.</p>

    <h2>PRESENTED AT COURT.</h2>

    <p>MR. PUNCH, SIR,</p>

    <p>I am indignant&mdash;disgusted! I went last night to see a
    new piece, called <i>The Guardsman</i>, at the Court Theatre,
    the plot of which, reminded me&mdash;'tis merely a
    coincidence&mdash;of <i>Incognita</i>, now going strong in St.
    Martin's Lane. The coincident being that a certain young man
    won't marry an uncertain young lady whom they want him to
    marry, because he is in love with quite another young lady (as
    he thinks) who (the <i>incognita</i>) turns out to be the very
    lady whom he is required to wed. However, that's not what I'm
    writing about. I leave criticism to your "professional gent."
    Well, Sir, it was very amusing, and very well acted. But from a
    military point of view, shameful, Sir!&mdash;shameful! The
    people about me were laughing, and said that the lines were
    good; that, take it all round, it ought to be a success; that
    it was most amusing. But how could I appreciate anything when I
    found a Captain in the Guards, on the Queen's Birthday, walking
    about in plain leather boots! It was as bad, in my mind, as
    when Mr. CHARLES WARNER, in the piece called <i>In the
    Ranks</i>, appeared as a private in the same distinguished
    Regiment in patent leathers! And what was the Captain doing,
    Sir, in mess uniform at his uncle's chambers, when he was
    supposed to be on guard at the Tower? At least so I understood
    him to be, but I may have been wrong. At any rate, an odd sort
    of place to dine at, if he was not on duty, and if he were, he
    should not have left his post. Moreover, where was his scarf,
    as orderly officer? But perhaps he was not on duty, and had
    dropped in upon the mess (in the height of the Season!) in a
    friendly sort of way. Well, that might explain matters a bit,
    but not to my entire satisfaction. And my wife tells me that it
    is rather late to make alterations in a Court dress the day
    before the Drawing-Room. And she says, too, that she has never
    been hustled and crushed when she has gone to Buckingham
    Palace. And if it comes to that, Sir, I have accompanied her,
    and can vouch for the strict accuracy of the statement. But
    these are minor matters. What I <i>cannot</i> stand are <i>The
    Guardsman's</i> boots!</p>

    the <i>Harrogate Advertiser</i> enthusiastically reproduced the
    entire article as published in <i>Mr. Punch's</i> pages,
    without saying "with your leave, or by your leave," to the
    Proprietors representing <i>Mr. Punch</i>. So, <i>Mr.
    Punch</i>, always kindly and courteous, was compelled in this
    instance to "know the reason why." Whereupon <i>The Harrogate
    Advertiser</i> acknowledged that it did not "harrogate to
    itself" any sort of right to republish wholesale without
    acknowledgment anything that has appeared in <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
    pages, and at once handsomely apologised for this instance of
    priggishness quite unprecedented in the <i>Harrogate
    Advertiser's</i> columns (<i>Vide Harrogate Advertiser</i>,
    October 15). <i>Box</i> and <i>Cox</i> are satisfied. <i>Causa
    flnita est. Vive</i> 'ARRY! Likewise 'Arrygate! And, know, all
    men, by these presents, that <i>Mr. P.</i> is quite
    wide-awake.</p>

    <h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's own Grouse in the Gun-room.</i>)</h4>

    <h3 class="sc">Lunch (continued).</h3>

    <p>How well I remember a certain day in the by-gone years, when
    for the first time a great truth suddenly burst upon me in all
    its glory. The morning's sport had been unsuccessful. We were
    all fairly tired, and some of us, in spite of the moderate
    temperature, were perspiring freely. For we had been walking up
    late partridges most of the morning, with just an occasional
    shot here and there at pheasants in covert. Now, late
    partridges are perhaps the least amenable of created things.
    They cherish a perfectly ridiculous conviction that nature, in
    endowing them with life, intended that they should preserve it,
    and consequently they hold it to be their one aim and object to
    fly, whirring and cheeping, out of sight, long before even an
    enthusiastic shot could have a chance of proving to them how
    beautifully a bird can be missed. For some reason or other, our
    host had refused or had been unable to drive the birds. One
    result was that we had tramped and tramped and tramped, getting
    only rare shots, and doing but little execution. Another result
    was, that the place was simply littered with lost tempers, and
    we sat down to lunch very much out of conceit with ourselves,
    our guns, our cartridges, the keepers, the dogs, and everything
    else. The pleasant array of plates and glasses, and the savoury
    odours of the meats mitigated, but did not dispel the frowns.
    Then suddenly there dropped down amongst us, as it were from
    the sky, the Great Woodcock Saga. In a moment the events of the
    morning were forgotten, brows cleared, tempers were picked up,
    and an eager hilarity reigned over the company, while the
    adventures of the wonderful bird were pursued from tree to
    tree, from clump to clump, through all the zig-zags of his
    marvellous flight, until he finally vanished triumphantly into
    the unknown.</p>

    <p>Now the Great Woodcock Saga is brought about in this
    way:&mdash;First of all suppose that a woodcock has shown
    himself somewhere or other during the morning. If he was seen
    it follows, as the day follows the night, (1), that
    <i>everybody</i> shot at him at the most fantastic distances
    without regard to the lives and limbs of the rest of the party;
    (2), that (in most cases) everybody missed him; (3), that
    everybody, though having, according to his own version, been
    especially careful himself, has been placed in imminent peril
    by the recklessness of the rest; (4), that everybody threw
    himself flat on his face to avoid death; and (5), that the
    woodcock is not really a bird at all, but a devil. The
    following is suggested as an example of Woodcock-dialogue, the
    scene being laid at lunch:&mdash;</p>

        breaking in</i>). Tickled <i>him</i> up! By gum, I thought
        <i>I</i> was going to be tickled up, I tell you. Shot was
        flying all round me&mdash;bang! bang! all over the place. I
        loosed off twice at him, and then went down, to avoid
        punishment. Haven't a notion what became of him.</p>

        <p><i>Third Sportsman</i> (<i>choking with laughter at the
        recollection</i>). I saw you go down, old cock. First go
        off, I thought you were hit: but, when you got that old
        face of yours up, and began to holler "Wor guns!" as if you
        meant to bust, why I jolly soon knew there wasn't much the
        matter with <i>you</i>. Just look at him, you chaps. Do you
        think an ordinary charge of shot would go through
        <i>that</i>? Not likely.</p>

        <p><i>Fourth Sportsman</i> (<i>military man</i>). Gad, it
        was awful! I'd rather be bucketed about by EVELYN WOOD for
        a week than face another woodcock. I heard 'em shoutin',
        "Woodcock forward! Woodcock back! Woodcock to the right!
        Woodcock to the left! Mark&mdash;mark!" Gad! thinks I to
        myself, the bally place must be full of 'em. Just then out
        he came, as sly as be blowed. My old bundook went off of
        its own accord. I bagged the best part of an oak tree, and,
        after that, I scooted. Things were gettin' just a shade too
        warm, by gad! A reg'lar hail-storm, that's what it was. No,
        thank you, thinks I; not for this party&mdash;I'm off to
        cover. So that's all <i>I</i> know about it. Thanks,
        TOMMY&mdash;do you mind handin' round that beer-jug?</p>

        <p><i>First Sportsman</i> (<i>rallying him</i>). Just think
        of that. And we're all of us taxed to keep a chap like that
        in comfort. Why you're <i>paid</i> to be shot
        at&mdash;that's what you're <i>there</i> for, you and your
        thin red line, and all that. By Jupiter! we don't get our
        money's worth out of you if you're going to cut and run
        before a poor, weak, harmless woodcock.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Military Sportsman <i>is heavily chaffed.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Military Sportsman</i>. Oh, it's all very well for
        you Johnnies to gas like that&mdash;but, by Gad, you didn't
        seem over-anxious to stand fire yourselves. Why your teeth
        are chattering still, BINKS.</p>

        <p><i>Binks</i>. Ah, but I'm only a poor civilian.</p>

        <p><i>Military Sportsman</i>. Well, I cut and ran as a
        civilian. See? Did anyone shoot the bloomin' bird, after
        all?</p>

        <p><i>The Host</i>. <i>Shoot</i> him? I should think not.
        The last I saw of him he was sailing off quite comfortable,
        cocking snooks at the whole lot. Have another go of pie,
        JOHNNY?</p>
    </div>

    <p>So that is the Great Woodcock Saga, the absolute accuracy of
    which every sportsman is bound to recognise. And the great
    truth that burst upon me is this, that if you want to restore
    good temper to a shattered party, you must start talking about
    woodcocks. If you saw a woodcock in the morning, talk about
    that one. If not, begin about the woodcock you saw last week,
    or the woodcock somebody else missed the week before. But
    whatever you do, always keep a woodcock for a (metaphorically)
    rainy day. Bring him out at lunch next time you shoot, and
    watch the effect.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
